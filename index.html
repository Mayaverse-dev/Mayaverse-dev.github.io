                warnings, methods, hacks. A cave painting warning which berries
                are poisonous, a folktale teaching wit and ingenuity, a film

                In 1989, a biologist demonstrated this power of narrative. Male
                barn swallows with darker red chests attract more females - it's
                an evolutionary signal of genetic fitness. When he painted a
                rejected male's chest with a one-dollar marker, females found
                him irresistible. Even more irresistible than naturally
                red-chested males.

                but more useful. As vast as the Mahabharata, but addressing
                humanity's most urgent challenges.

                Insignificant Man and pioneered narrative experiences in virtual
                reality. His work has elicited measurable positive behavior
                impact.

                acquired by Disney, Netflix, Amazon PrimeVideo, Channel 4, BBC,
                Hulu, among others. The universal appeal of his storytelling has
