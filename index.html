                In 1989, a biologist demonstrated this power of narrative. Male
                barn swallows with darker red chests attract more females - it's
                an evolutionary signal of genetic fitness. When he painted a
                rejected male's chest with a one-dollar marker, females found
                him irresistible. Even more irresistible than naturally

              <p>
                Anand Gandhi is a visionary filmmaker renowned for ushering in a
                new wave of Indian cinema. His debut film, Ship of Theseus, won
                the National Award for Best Picture—the Indian equivalent of an
                Academy Award—and was listed among 15 “life-changing” films of
                the past century by The Critics’ Circle, UK. His subsequent
                film, Tumbbad, became the region’s most-watched genre film of
                the last two decades. He transformed the documentary cinema
                landscape by producing An Insignificant Man. He pioneered
                virtual reality narrative experiences. Anand’s work has elicited
                measurable positive behavior impact and progressive legal
                precedent in the region. It has also inspired hundreds of
                academic commentaries and papers. His work has premiered and
                been awarded at the International Film festivals of Toronto,
                Venice, Rotterdam, Transylvania, Sydney, London BFI, Dubai and
                Tokyo amongst hundreds of others. His films have been acquired
                by Disney, Netflix, Amazon PrimeVideo, Channel 4, BBC, Hulu,
                among others.

                We begin with Maya - a story universe that demonstrates the full
                potential of our vision. Set on the planet Samsaar, Maya
                introduces a civilization where a superintelligent network,
                grown from ancient trees, governs society through shared dreams.
                From birth, every child is tethered to this network, immersing
                in simulations far more vivid than reality itself.
